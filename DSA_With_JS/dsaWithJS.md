Big O notation 👍

Big O notation is a mathematical notation that helps us understand the performance of an algorithm. It does it by providing two factors,
i) time complexity -> the time taken by an algorithm to find solution
ii) space complexity -> the space/memory consumed by that algorithm to find that solution.

There are several type of notations like:

1) O(n) - Linear time

Means the time of the algorithm grows as per the size of the input. So, the time here is directly proportional to the size of the input.

2) O(1) - Constant time

Means the time taken by the algorithm to complete will remain constant irrespective of the size of the input

3) O(n^2) - Quadratic time

Means the time taken by the algorithm will grow in proportionate to the size of the square of the input size. Example, nested loops

4) O(log n) - Logarithmic time 

Means here the number so operations performed is proportional to the logarithm of the input size. Example, divide and conquor approach. The algorithm's running time increases slowly as the number of input grows
